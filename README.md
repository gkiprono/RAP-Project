# Bank

# Description

   The Bank app is a console-based application that simulates banking operations. A customer can apply for an account, view their balance, and make withdrawals and deposits. An employee can approve or deny accounts and view account balances for their customers.
	
## Purpose

   We want to see that you can meet deadlines and that you can code. You are expected to complete the following requirements and give a 5-10 minute presentation of your project.

## Requirements
1. Functionality should reflect the below user stories.
2. Data is stored in a database.
3. Data Access is performed through the use of JDBC in a data layer consisting of Data Access Objects.
4. All input is received using the java.util.Scanner class.
5. Log4j is implemented to log events to a file.
6. A minimum of 10 JUnit tests are written to test some functionality.



Project Evaluation Parameters
1) Your project will be evaluated based on coverage of technology rather than the user stories.
2) How well you present, naming conventions, separation of code into various classes, how well have you applied OOP and design patterns.
3) So you could focus less on user stories and more on coverage of concepts/technologies which you learned during the training.
